## Analysis
The first crossword (structure0.txt) was generated within a second which was expected since the dataset of words and the number of words in the crossword were small amounts.

The second  crossword (structure1.txt) had a longer execution time due to the increases number of words available in words1.txt and the increased number of words in the puzzle.

The third crossword (structure2.txt) was the most difficult to attempt. The strategy is to begin solving the puzzle with the longest words first and then insert the next longest word. Also, words with more vowels are highly desirable as they offer more combinations than consonants.
After several attempts to modify the crossword.py file to decrement from an 11 letter word, I was unfortunately unable to complete the puzzle.
If time allows, I wish to return to the third puzzle and make extra attempts to solve it before the conclusion of the semester.
